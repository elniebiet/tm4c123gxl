BLINKING THE LED

lower addresses starting from:
 0 are mapped to the flash memory
 2 are mapped to the RAM
 
 LED is mapped connected to GPIO port - see User Manual
 
 * search for memory map in datasheet:
 * locate GPIO port F addresses
 * Clock gating is done by default to save power, need to turn on clock for Port F
 * search for clock gating
 * search GPIO to see instruction for enabling clock for port F
 
 *Copy base address,
 *offset needs to be added to base to get the complete address
 *open symbolic memory view to change the bit 5 of the clock gating register (add offset), watch change in start address of port F
 *configure GPIO port f pins 1 2 3 as output, search
 *configure GPIO port f pins 1 2 3 as digital output
