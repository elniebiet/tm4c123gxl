stdint.h AND MIXING TYPES

micro-c os / os2 uses typedef to define with for data types

stdint provided in C99 standard, most valuable feature of C99
find stdint.h in C:\Program Files (x86)\IAR Systems\Embedded Workbench 8.4\arm\inc\c

sample std datatypes used: 

int8_t, uint8_t, int32_t (signed 32 bit integer) ...

arm uses special instruction to read and write bits, halfwords and whole words
LDRB - bits
LDRH - half-words
LDR - whole-words

C promotes integer variables to built-in types before promoting any expression

do explicit casting to the largest of the operands

do explicit casting to the type of the operand to the left 

uint32_t sum = 10 - (uint32_t)num; //10 is signed by default

comparison must be done with same datatypes, do explicit casting or promotion
