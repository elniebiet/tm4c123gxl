PITFALLS OF FUNCTIONS

stack overflow

-> view -> call stack
-> view -> stack 1 

change stack size

project -> options -> Linker -> override default ->
							-> edit (default is 2kb) = 1kb is enough
							-> heap = 0
							-> save config file: *.icf
							
Heap:
for dynamic memory allocation,
likes of malloc and free use it
in real time should not be used, causes more harm than good in embedded systems,
set it to 0.


Static: allocate variable outside the stack, specifically in the RAM, 
so it can be accessed even when the function returns
