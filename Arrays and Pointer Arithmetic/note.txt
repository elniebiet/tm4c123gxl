ARRAYS AND POINTER ARITHMETIC 

Each GPIO bit can be treated as a register having its own address.

e.g to set bit 3 of 0x40025000
can say: data in 0x40025008 = 0x00001000

can set bits of address, like GPIO address as array: 
e.g GPIOF_DATA_R[LED_RED] = LED_RED
or *(GPIOF_DATA_R + LED_RED) = LED_RED; //set register as if to set just that bit in the address
