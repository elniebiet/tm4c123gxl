MODULES , RECURSION AND AAPCS - Arm Application Procedure Call Standards

- create header file 
- create c file 
- include delay function

if a return function is not to return anything, cast it to void
e.g unsigned fact(int number);
(void)fact(10);

AAPCS : saving data from registers to be used during function call and returning the data back ... complex long agreement
