FLOW OF CONTROL

While loop:
instructions: 

MOVS R0, #0
B.N  ??main_0 //branch instruction
CMP  R0, #21 //compare R0 to 21, modifies APSR (Application Program Status Register) set/clear N bit of register
BLT.N ??main_1 //executes when N-bit is set for APSR or jumps to next instruction
        //pc address for BLT instruction: eg. 0xdbfc: d = T1 encoding; b == condition; fc = offset fc = -4 == current pc - 4
		
disadvantages
- loop overhead 
- pipeline stalls for a few cycles : pipeline: fetch, decode, execute
